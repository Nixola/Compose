# Compose
A thing to make music.
Some instructions if anybody wants to try it:
Left click on a square to add/edit/delete a note. A circle is a single note, a "<" is the beginning of a long note, a ">" is its end, while an empty square is nothing. Right click to delete a note.
Up and down change the tempo, which isn't actually written anywhere in the screen, so this love file is better used from a terminal (where the tempo is printed). Please don't change it while playing.
Space starts and pauses playback (please don't change tempo while paused either), while escape will stop (pause and rewind) it.
You can scroll vertically with the mousewheel (or shift + horizontal wheel, or other secondary buttons I guess), horizontally with horizontal wheel (or shift + vertical wheel).
I think that pretty much covers it.
